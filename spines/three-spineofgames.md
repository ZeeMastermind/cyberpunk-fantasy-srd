# What is Shadowrun?

In Shadowrun, you play as a "shadowrunner-" a sort of mercenary, criminal, or neighborhood problem-solver that takes on various jobs for profit or personal reasons. You and the other players act as a team to complete these jobs. Most of the time, you'll be taking a job on behalf of a corporation, and attacking another corporation. This could be a theft, a data-steal (Hacking job), kidnapping, or even an assassination. Shadowrunners do whatever dirty work needs to be done, whether it's for the greater good of the neighborhood or for the greater good of your wallet.

Ocean's 11, Burn Notice, Blade Runner, Cowboy Bebop, and Altered Carbon all have similar structures to what these jobs might look like.

The world of Shadowrun is much like Earth. In fact, it is on Earth- 30-50 years into the future. There's also dragons involved, and the return of magic, and a bunch of other things that really liven things up. We recommend that you read the official material to get the full rundown on this, otherwise there are a few free sites online you can go to for more information.

Shadowrun is a tabletop roleplaying game. A tabletop roleplaying game (Or "TTRPG") is a type of game where players describe their character's actions in a fictional world. This is similar to improv theater or group storytelling, but with structure. The rules provide ways for you to determine if your character succeeds or fails, and the gamemaster (GM) serves as a referee to provide "rulings" on these rules, and to describe the world around the characters.

In the past, this was played with pen and paper, or even miniatures on battle grids. A lot of groups still do that. However, some folks are playing online using tools like Discord and Roll20.

What has stayed the same is the use of dice. Dice provide a way of creating random results. In a TV show, there are times of uncertainty- will the heroes succeed? Will the villains get away? Who lives and who dies? In a tabletop roleplaying game, these moments of tension are determined by the cleverness of players and the results of the dice. Shadowrun relies a lot on players to plan out jobs and seek out the most advantageous positions for their characters. Even the toughest troll can't barrel their way through 10 levels of security, and even the sneakiest ninja needs building plans and magical overwatch. The characters work as a team and plan out the best way to complete the job.

Shadowrun is a lethal game. For the characters, that is. It's difficult at first, and a stray bullet could take your character out at any time. Such is life in the world of Shadowrun. Some groups tailor the game to make it less lethal. Following in the steps of Cowboy Bebop and other cyberpunk stories, these games follow character arcs for a long time. The characters aren't omnipotent, and in fact they may lose a lot more than they gain.

With any rule, the GM and the group are free to tailor it to their liking. TTRPGs are just words on paper- it's the group that makes the game run.
