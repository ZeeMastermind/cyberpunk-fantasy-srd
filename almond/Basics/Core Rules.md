# Tests

Tests are used to resolve the results of an action.

When a character faces an obstacle or performs an action where the outcome is uncertain, the player uses six-sided dice (Sometimes called "d6") in order to resolve the action. The results of this dice roll determine whether or not they succeed.

Almond has a dice system more complex than players will be used to in other board games, so make sure to read through these rules carefully. Almond uses acronyms to keep the rules efficient, so use this as a reference when you first start playing.

The number of dice a player rolls is determined by the type of test they take (Described in the "Types of Tests" section), but first the game master must determine the difficulty of the test (Described in the "How to Roll" section). Finally, "Difficulty Chart" shows how Target Numbers map to the various difficulties.

## How to Roll

### Target Numbers (TN)

Target numbers, or "TN," are a measure of how difficult something is. Higher TNs represent more difficult tasks. When the player performs a test, the gamemaster first tells them what the TN is. When a player rolls dice, every die they roll that is equal to or greater than the TN counts as a **success**. Do not add all of your dice (your "dice pool") together- each die has its own value.

TNs can never be less than 2. If modifiers, described below, would reduce a TN to less than 2, treat the TN as if it is 2.

### Modifiers

Modifiers represent situational advantages and disadvantages that affect a character's test. In most cases, modifiers change the target number. A +1 modifier means that the target number is increased by 1. A TN 4 with a +1 modifier would become TN 5.

Some modifiers affect the number of dice a player rolls. A "-2d" modifier means -2 dice. The player would roll 2 less dice. So if a player would normally roll 5 dice (Or "5d6") but had a -2d modifier, they would only roll 3d6.

### Rolling Rules

Aside from getting successes, there are other die values that have rules.

#### Ones

If a die comes up as a one, then that die is a failure. TNs can never be less than 2, so any die that is a one is a failure.

Additionally, if all dice are ones, the character has failed even worse than expected. A missed shot might become friendly fire, a failure to sneak past a guard might trigger an extra alarm, and so on. The gamemaster determines what this special failure is based on the tone of the group and the situation.

#### Sixes

Any time a die comes up as a six, it can be rerolled. The rerolled value is added to the six. This is how characters can succeed at tests with TNs that are greater than 6.

For example, let's say Sammy rolls a 4, 2, 6, and 6. Sammy would then reroll the sixes. The new results are 3 and 1. This means that Sammy's final results are 4, 2, 9, and 7. If Sammy had rolled another six, they would be able to reroll it, and get an even higher number! Once the player has reached or beaten the TN with their die, they can stop rolling. All that matters is that they get a success, it does not matter how much of a success it is.

For large TNs of 15+, you should use scratch paper to keep track.

As explained in the combat chapter, sixes are not rerolled when calculating initiative.
