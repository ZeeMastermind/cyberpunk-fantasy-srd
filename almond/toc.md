# Table of Contents

This also serves as a tracker for progress.

Status Key:

* **Not Started**: Hasn't been done yet. If nobody is listed under "responsibility," feel free to pick it up.
* **WIP**: It is in progress, but not ready for editing.
* **Edit**: Editing is done in phases.
  * Internal Edit: Ready to be edited internally (Does this match the objectives of Almond, is this consistent with other rules, does it follow the tenets of the elements of style, is everything spelled right, etc). For this, we can peer edit.
  * External Edit: Ready to be edited by someone outside the project (Is this understandable, do we have any expert blind spots, did we miss a typo, etc). This helps us get a "lay" perspective. For this, we should acquire a pool of contacts who are interested in the project, but perhaps too busy to do any writing.
* **Review**: In-depth playtesting is not required for Almond, since its goals are to stick close to RAW/RAI. However, before a chapter goes "gold," it will be posted and made available for public comment for a month. Once any outstanding issues are resolved, it goes "gold." Ideally, we do this in bulk, one section at a time.
* **Gold:** Don't touch it unless serious errata is needed. If that's what's written, then that's what's written.

Table of contents may split chapters into passages. Ideally, you have one person doing a whole chapter to keep consistency, but some (Like gear, creatures, running, etc)
