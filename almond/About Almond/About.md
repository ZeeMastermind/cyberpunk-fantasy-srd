Here are the objectives of Almond gameplay:

- Rules are detailed. GM fiat and rulings should only be necessary in edge cases.
- Character capabilities will closely match the fiction.
- Crunch and complexity are high in character creation and advancement.
- Gameplay is efficient. The “Action->Mechanic->Result” loop of  this TTRPG should focus more time on the Action and Result than the Mechanic. Don't let the interface get in the way of the game.
- Go through the damn rulebook with a damn copy of the Elements of  Style. Reading a rule once must allow the reader to understand the rule
- Rules are clear; the ways rules interact are clear and thought out.
- No "pizza time" for any role. The GM section should explain clearly how to handle "legwork" and "action," and give advice on when to switch the camera.
